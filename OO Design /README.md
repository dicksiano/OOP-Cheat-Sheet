Brainstorm

* **Handle ambiguity**: be clear about "What is the problem and what are the boundaries?"

* **Core classes**: think about the responsibility of each class

* **Define the relations between classes**: composition, aggregation, inherit, many-to-many, one-to-one. Draw an initial UML diagram

* **Think about the methods and members**: turn relations and responsibilities into methods.
