Brainstorm

* **Handle ambiguity**: be clear about "What is the problem and what are the boundaries?"

* **Core classes**: think about each class responsability

* **Define the relations betweem classes**: composition, agreggation, inherit, many-to-many, one-to-one. Draw a UML diagram

* **Think about the methods and members**: turn relations and responsabilities into methods.
